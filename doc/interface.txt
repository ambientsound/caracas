Interface behavior and requirements
===================================

Starting and stopping the car
-----------------------------

When the ignition key is switched to ACC, the Raspberry PI starts to boot, and
the Android phone is switched to online mode. Any shutdown timer is disabled.

When the ignition key is switched to OFF, the Android phone is switched to
offline mode. A shutdown timer starts on the Raspberry PI.

When the shutdown timer reaches zero, the Raspberry PI synchronizes all data
and sends a kill signal to GPIO pin 11 (HIGH). This cuts off power to the
Raspberry PI.
